# shuffle

To Set UP

Download the Neo4j community edition

Start a graph giving it username and password, 

Fill in the {username} and {password} with your neo4j and your password in your code so it should look like var driver = neo4j.driver('bolt://localhost', neo4j.auth.basic("neo4j", '{password}'));

make sure this is done in all the handlers where neo4j is used

cd into shuffle
npm install
nodemon index.js

Code should work
